This is the directory for the Bioperl C compiled Extensions.

These currently include:

   Bio::Ext::Align (Ewan Birney <birney@sanger.ac.uk> and Yee Man Chan <ymc@paxil.stanford.edu>)
   Bio::SeqIO::staden::read (Aaron Mackey <amackey@virginia.edu>)

To install all of the extension packages, you can use the top-level
Makefile.PL (present in the same directory you're reading this README
from) (Make sure you read the various notes below about each package
before doing this!):

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install (may need root permissions)

To install only the individual extensions you wish to have, change directories into each and use the Makefile.PL found there; for example:

  cd Bio/Ext/Align
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test (should print out alignment on STDERR)
  make install (probably need root permissions).

Notes for Bio::Ext::Align

Although these extensions can be called by themselves, they
really need the main bioperl distribution to drive them. The
modules which do this are 

   Bio::Tools::pSW - makes Smith-Waterman alignments for DNA
   Bio::Tolls::dpAlign - makes Smith-Waterman alignments for proteins
   Bio::SearchDist - deals with EVD fitting of extreme value distributions

For more information on how to use these modules, read their own documentation
(perldoc Bio::Tools::pSW ...)


Notes for Bio::SeqIO::staden::read

This extension needs the rest of the main bioperl distribution to
function properly.  It is only useful as a helper module for the SeqIO
system to read sequence trace files handled by the Staden package's
io_lib "read" library.  You should have this library installed prior
to installing Bio::SeqIO::staden::read, it's currently available at:

  ftp://ftp.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/pub/staden/io_lib/

Many users have noted that the io_lib install process often forgets to
install the "os.h" file along with the rest of the include files; you
may have to do this manually.

The bioperl-ext make process will prompt you for the LIB and INCLUDE
locations (usually /usr/local/lib and usr/local/include/io_lib,
respectively) of the io_lib "libread" library and Read.h header files,
after trying to automatically find them.  You may also specify these
via the environment variables "IOLIB_LIB" and "IOLIB_INC", or via
identically named options to perl Makefile.PL:

  perl Makefile.PL IOLIB_LIB=/opt/lib IOLIB_INC=/opt/include/io_lib

Ignore any warnings about these options being unknown to MakeMaker.

A failed compilation is most likely due to an incomplete io_lib
installation; make sure that all the required io_lib ".h" files are in
place.
