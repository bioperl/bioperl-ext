 This is the directory for the Bioperl C compiled Extensions.
The main author for this is Ewan Birney <birney@sanger.ac.uk>

 To install...

 cd into Bio/Ext/Align
 go perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test (should print out alignment on STDERR)
 make install (probably need root permissions).


Although these extensions can be called by themselves, they
really need the main bioperl distribution to drive them. The
modules which do this are 

   Bio::Tools::pSW - makes smith waterman alignments
   Bio::SearchDist - deals with EVD fitting of extreme value distributions

For more information on how to use these modules, read their own documentation
(go perldoc Bio::Tools::pSW ...)
